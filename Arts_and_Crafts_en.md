### Afterschool Arts and Crafts (extra-curricular activity)

Children are guided to use a wide variety of natural and man-made materials (both new and recycled) and media, including: textiles, paper products, plant materials, recycled plastics, clay, paint, oil pastels etc. to produce a diverse range of 2D and 3D artworks and objects.  

The activities are intended to be enjoyable and engaging and to present an appropriate level of difficulty, such that the children derive satisfaction from the process and the results whilst also building confidence through overcoming challenges and becoming aware of their improved skills and capacities over time. When engaging with tasks, the children are encouraged to explore and experiment with different ways to use materials and express themselves.  

Whilst a potential sample output is shown for each session and all tasks have a degree of structure, the objective is to stimulate and facilitate creativity and imagination. When the activity diverges from the initial plan, it is usually a good sign that the children have taken ownership and decided for themselves to use materials in a different way to that which has been suggested.  

‘Arts and crafts’ is not an academic activity with academic learning objectives, although students have the opportunity to develop skills that are applicable to other learning areas, for example: to design and technology (practical knowledge of different construction techniques for joining materials) and mathematics (identifying, designing and producing patterns).  

#### Content and language integrated learning (CLIL)

The arts and crafts afterschool activity is offered in a content and language integrated learning mode, that is, the instruction is entirely in English, with a secondary objective to expose the children to and, over the medium term, promote language learning and comprehension in English. Manual arts and crafts activities are particularly suited to CLIL instruction. The hands-on physical nature of activities means that clear demonstrations can be given to accompany English-language instructions and explanations, facilitating student comprehension and minimizing the cognitive load of processing the ‘other’ language.
