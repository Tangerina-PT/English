Let's take a walk in the jungle. (Vamos caminhar na selva.)  
Walking in the jungle. Walking in the jungle. (A caminhar na selva. X 2)  
We're not afraid. We're not afraid.  (Nós não temos medo. X 2)  
Walking in the jungle. Walking in the jungle.   
We're not afraid. We're not afraid.  
One step. Two steps. Three steps forward. (Um passo. Dois passos. Três passos para frente.)  
One step. Two steps. Three steps back. (Um passo. Dois passos. Três passos para trás.)  
Stop. Listen. What's that? (Para. Escuta. O que é isso/aquilo?)  
It's a frog! (É uma rã.)  
We're not afraid! (Nós não temos medo.)

Let's stomp. (Vamos caminhar a pisar o chão com força.)  
Stomping in the jungle. Stomping in the jungle. (A caminhar (a pisar o chão com força) na selva. X 2)  
We're not afraid. We're not afraid.  
Stomping in the jungle. Stomping in the jungle.   
We're not afraid. We're not afraid.  
One step. Two steps. Three steps forward.  
One step. Two steps. Three steps back.  
Stop. Listen. What's that?  
It's a monkey! (É um macaco.)  
We're not afraid!

Let's jump. (Vamos saltar/pular.)   
Jumping in the jungle. Jumping in the jungle. (A pular na selva. X 2)  
We're not afraid. We're not afraid.  
Jumping in the jungle. Jumping in the jungle.   
We're not afraid. We're not afraid.  
One step. Two steps. Three steps forward.  
One step. Two steps. Three steps back.  
Stop. Listen. What's that?   
It's a toucan! (É um toucano.)  
We're not afraid!

Let's skip. (Vamos (ver vídeos da parte de baixo da página principal))  
Skipping in the jungle. Skipping in the jungle. We're not afraid. We're not afraid.  
Skipping in the jungle. Skipping in the jungle. We're not afraid. We're not afraid.  
One step. Two steps. Three steps forward.  
One step. Two steps. Three steps back.  
Stop. Listen. What's that?  
It's a tiger!  (É um tigre.)  
RUN! (Corre!)
